# cybersecurity_Red_vs_Blue-project2

The purpose of this project was to practice the roles of a pentester and SOC analyst.   

- Find vulnerabilities / exploits to gain access to a vulnerable Apache web server.   
- Analyze ELK logs for Indicators of attack and to identify the type of attacks.  
- Documentation of findings to create a presentation on the assessment, analysis and hardening of the vulnerable system.

The Red Team attacked a vulnerable system. The ELK server logged the activity information, which the Blue Team reviewed through Kibana. The work, processes, notes, and findings from both Red Team and Blue Team perspective lead up to creation of the final presentation.
